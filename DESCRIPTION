#Description: This package contains functions that quickly create visualizations of your dataset. User can create:
  #Quadruple-variate scatterplot with a trend line. This plot measures 2 main variables on the axes and 2 subsequent variables through plot point size and color, respectively.
    #data = dataset, x = x variable, y = y variable, d = 1st sub variable, e = 2nd sub variable.
  #Correlational heatmap of specified variables from user's dataset (numerical only). User specifies colors and title.
    #data = numerical dataset, color1 = hex color code("#xxxxxx") of negative correlation, color2 = hex color code("#xxxxxx") of positive correlation, title = "[title here]"
  #Time-series line graph visualization of user's dataset. User specifies colors and title.
    #data = dataset, x = x variable, y = y variable, color = hex color code("#xxxxxx"), title = "[title here]"
